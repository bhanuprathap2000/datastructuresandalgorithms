What is a linked list?

Linked list is a form of sequential data structure(the nodes can be at any memory location need not to be continous). It is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (or link) to the next node in the list.

A node will contain data and a reference to the next node.

Linked list has head and tail pointers.which will point to the first and last node respectively.

Linked List vs Arrays

Elements of linked list are independent objects

Variable size -the number of elements in the list is not fixed

Insertion and removals in linked list are very efficient

Random access is not possible in linked list and in array it is possible

For accessing elements in linked list, we need to traverse the list from the beginning or the end.

Types of linked list

    Singly linked list
    Circular Singly linked list-example chess game
    Doubly linked list-example music player
    Circular Doubly linked list-example swicthing between multiple  desktop application in windows

nodes are alloted in random order
