Vectors are sequence containers representing the arrays which can grow in size
just like arrays vectors use the contigous memory location for thier elements and can be accessed directly in O(1).
But unlike arrays their size can change dynamically with heir  storgae is automatically handled by the container.

How vectors work internally?

Vector first create a dynamic array by the specified size and when we try to add more elements than the specified size

first it will allocate another array with the double the size of the prsent array and copies all the elements and adds new elements

deallcating of the previous is done 

in this way the vectors work internally.
