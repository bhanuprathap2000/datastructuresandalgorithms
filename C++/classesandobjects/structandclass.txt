In c++ we can also use the struct to create objects
but only difference is that by defauklt for struct members are public
and for class they are private

Struct 
use struct for passive objects(simple behaviour) with public access
Don't declare methods in struct

class
use class for active objects with private access
implement getters and setters methods
implement method members as needed.
