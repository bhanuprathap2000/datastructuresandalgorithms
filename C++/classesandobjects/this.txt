this is a reserved keyword

contains the address of the object-so it's a pointer to the object

can only be used in the class scope

All member access is done via the this pointer

Can be used by the programmer
To access data member and methods
to determine if two objects are the same 
can be dereferenced to get the current object

We can directly access the members because it's done for us by compiler

when the formal parameter and object member have the same name then 
it's better to use this->memebr=parameter


in case of objects wer can use the . operator to access the members

in case of pointers to the objects in heap we can use the -> operator to access the members

inside the class we can use the this pointer to access the members of the object that will be created from the class
