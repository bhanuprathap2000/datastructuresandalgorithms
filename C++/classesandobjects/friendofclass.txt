Friend 

a function or class that has access to private class member

when
Function
can be regular non member function that means not associated with any clas just a normal function and it's not a member of the class it is the Friend
can be memebr methods of another class

When 
class
Another class can have access to private class memebrs


Friend of a class
Friendship must be granted not taken
Decalred explicitly in the class that is granting Friendship
decalred in the function prototype with the keyword Friend
Friendship is not symmetric 

Must be explicitly granted
if a is friend of b
then b is not friend a must be explicitly decalred

Not transitive
If a is friend of be
b is friend of c
then a is not friend of c


so the syntax is like this

class Player{

    friend void display_player(Player &p1);
    ...
};

This by passes the concept of encapsulation we need to careful aboout which function or class to make the friend.
