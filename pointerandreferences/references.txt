A reference is an alias to the variable

must be initialized to a variable when declared

cannot be null

once initialized cannot be made to refer to a different variable

very useful as function parameters

might be helpful to think of reference as the const pointer that is automatically dereferenced.

pass by refrence variables is much easier and better than pass by pointers variables
